# Water-Dispenser-for-birds

This is just a simple Arduino Uno based circuit that allows water to move from the main tank to the water storage container for the bird and then to a water bottle for it using 2 Ultrasonic sensors

Super simple project to get started with uno and explore Ultrasonic sensors and a servo motor
